# 💉 INJECTUM

Injectum is an ethical game enhancement tool designed to push the limits of undetected external cheats. Built under Oxyum Networks, this project is currently in development, aiming to be universally undetected across all major anti-cheats.

# 🚀 Features (Planned)

✅ External & Undetected – No memory injection, no flags.

🧠 YOLO-Based Object Detection – Using real AI (You Only Look Once) to spot targets with precision.

🎯 Aimbot (Coming Soon) – Auto-aim tech powered by computer vision.

🕹️ Undetectable Input System (WIP) – Bypasses anti-cheats that sniff for simulated inputs via Windows APIs.

🧪 Designed with ethical testing and learning purposes in mind.

# ⚠️ Current Status

Project is still in early development.

Aimbot input system is under heavy testing.

We’re actively working on avoiding detection from:

Riot Vanguard

Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC)

BattleEye

Any other annoying watchdogs 👀

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

YOLOv5 / YOLO-NAS

PyMeow

OpenCV

ImGui (planned for internal versions)

# 📦 Installation (Coming Soon)

Install instructions will be added once the first stable beta drops. Stay tuned.

# Trust Issues

I know some people have trust issues from getting ratted like me. I have the source code written to be as simple as I can possibly make it. I made it so its easy for you to read.
