# INJECTUM

injectum is a software used for hacking games like fortnite or roblox. You can check the code yourself
if you think this is a virus. I will try to make it easy to read. There are base64 decoding and encoding
but its only for anticheat softwares to detect example GetProc("roblox.com"). instead you just encode it using base64 and then decode it using a variable and using that variable as a spoofed process name.

# How Undetected is it?

Injectum uses yolo and possibly HID. Injectum provides different methods for different games.
Injectum bypassed:

VAC
EasyAntiCheat
Battleye
Vanguard

and we are working on bypassing Faceit AC.

# Does Injectum have a api?

In this current version, Injectum does not currently have a api. It will come hopefully.

# What languages does injectum use?

Injuectum uses c++, and python.

c++ for memory editing and python for external gui.
