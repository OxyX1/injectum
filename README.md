# THIS PROJECT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

# 💉 INJECTUM

Injectum is a cheating tool for multiple games like csgo, fortnite, roblox, and r6 by using yolo object detection to trace entities and objects.

# 🚀 Features

✅ External & Undetected – No memory injection, no flags.

🧠 YOLO-Based Object Detection – Using real AI (You Only Look Once) to spot targets with precision.

🎯 Aimbot – Auto-aim tech powered by computer vision.

🕹️ Undetectable Input System – Bypasses anti-cheats that sniff for simulated inputs via Windows APIs.

👁 YOLO-Based ESP that uses IMGUI to shows what the model is tracing.



# ⚠️ Current Status

Project is still in early development.

Aimbot input system is under heavy testing.

We’re actively working on avoiding detection from:

Riot Vanguard

Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC)

BattleEye

Any other annoying watchdogs 👀

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

YOLOv5 / YOLO-NAS

Dearpygui ( planning to implement internal gui injection. ) ( risky )

OpenCV

# 📦 Installation

To install the software, you need to open the main.bat, from there, you will see a "install" option input the number that the installation option is at and press enter.
You will see that it will start to install and after that, its already to go. If it didnt run, then make sure to install python or do these commands depending on what you have.

     Windows 10/11: "python --version"
     Windows 10 and lower: "py --version"
     Linux Distros: "python3 --version"
