how to use.

if you open the prebuilt folder then you will see there is a prebuilt exe that is the main program.
if you do not trust this program you can build the program yourself by running the installer.bat and the build.bat

the installer.bat installs gcc aka g++ to ensure that the build will work.
the build.bat runs the build command to build the exe. This project is open source so feel free
to look through the code if you think its suspicous and also feel free to make your own cheating software. This open source project was made because people are broke. And I made this so I dont have to worry about saving up money to buy a cheat that imma use for a month and then never use it again or if has a rat in it. I only made this free because those reasons and because people can just make cheats using ai now. Its 2025 if you want to make a paid software your going to have to make it big to were the point its impossible to make with ai. Anyways, im not gonna give you a full lecture on why I made this but here yah go :)

NOTE: if you trust us and use the prebuilt you can delete the source code if you like so its not a big messy file. But if your gonna build the software you have to keep the source code and then you could delete it after building the exe.
